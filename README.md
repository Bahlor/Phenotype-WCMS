Phenotype-WCMS
==============

Phenotype WCMS is a lightweight and easy to use content management system, originally created by Nils Hagemann, Paul Sellinger and Peter Selling. As this project is somewhat abandoned and I still think it is a great WCMS I added it to github. I will be providing some support and update it as often as I can.
